Project 2: Shopping Cart
========================

###Heroku URL

Please put it here: http://azcart.herokuapp.com

###Notes

Any instructions or notes for your grader should be placed here.

I've created several test users, seller1@mit.edu (pw: seller), buyer1@mit.edu (pw:buyer), buyer2@mit.edu (pw:buyer). Feel free to make more.

Please note that all sellers share the same catalog and have the same set of permissions.

###Code Deliverables

Your code should be a rails project located at the root of this repository. To
create a new rails project, run

    >> rails new .

in this directory.


###PDF Deliverables

Additional deliverables, such as the problem-analysis and the design-analysis, should
be saved as PDF files in the directory called "deliverables"
