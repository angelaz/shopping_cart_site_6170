Project 2: Shopping Cart
========================

###Heroku URL

Please put it here: http://azcart.herokuapp.com


###Description

AZCart is a lightweight web application that simulates a shopping cart experience online. AZCart provides a similar service as Opencart, Shopify, Paypal, and Stripe, but it fulfills the shopkeepers’ need for a more basic and minimal setup effort required product.

When a shopper is browsing a website, they can
1) create account/log in/log out
2) add items to the shopping cart
3) remove items
4) edit quantity of an item
5) checkout items in the cart
6) retain the shopping cart across browser sessions share shopping carts with other users


For a shopkeeper, AZCart will provide them a simple admin interface to:
1) add items to the catalog
2) edit a catalog item’s title, price, and quantity
3) approve or decline orders submitted by a user

###Notes

I've created several test users, seller1@mit.edu (pw: seller), seller2@mit.edu (pw: seller), buyer1@mit.edu (pw:buyer), buyer2@mit.edu (pw:buyer). Feel free to make more.

Please note that all sellers share the same catalog and have the same set of permissions.


###PDF Deliverables

Additional deliverables, such as the problem-analysis and the design-analysis, should
be saved as PDF files in the directory called "deliverables"
